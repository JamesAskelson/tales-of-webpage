            <h2>Amazing Coop games</h2>
            <p>Tales of games are well known for their coop systems. Many of them feature up to 6-8 characters that
                are
                all playable and selectable by more than 1 person. This is big, because the action jrpg genre is
                short
                on coop features for a big majority of games in that genre, so a franchise that dedicated itself to
                letting
                you grab your friends and embark on a 40+ hour quest was honestly unheard of. It's sad that in the
                most
                recent
                game, Tales of the Arise, they focused on single player and completely removed coop when it was a
                huge
                part
                of the franchise for most of its lifespan.</p>

            <h2>Great stories</h2>
            <p>While not all the tales of stories are incredible, some of the best ones have top notch stories.
                Tales of
                symphonia is about a journey across the world to help your friend rid the world of beings known as
                desians
                that push slavery of the majority of the world, finding out along the way all of the conspiracy
                behind
                the
                journey you were pushed to take in the first place and finding out what you can do to save both your
                friends
                and the world. Tales of the Abyss is an incredible tale as well, with the main character being one
                of
                the most
                developed characters i've ever seen in a game, going from a snobby noble child, to coping with
                causing
                the deaths
                of thousands due to your own huberice, and finally coming to terms with what you've done, who you
                are,
                and what you can do for the world.

            <h2>Incredible and Deep Combat Systems</h2>
            <p>Tales of is known for having many systems and combo combat that changes from game to game. Symphonia
                started the Multi-Line Linear Motion Battle System, where you follow a line to targets where you can
                block, combo, or try to jump to manuever around them. Then, in abyss, they added the free run that
                let
                you go off the line you were on to avoid attacks or remanuever yourself. Many games after added
                things
                to both spice up combat and change up tactics, like vesperia's fatal strikes to finish off weak
                foes,
                graces A/B artes system to let players basically freeform their combos, and ect. More recent games
                have
                seemed to forgotten player expression and dumbed down a lot of the combat, starting with Zesteria.
                Since
                that game, every subsequent game after has felt like they don't know what they are doing, which is a
                shame because they had so many fun titles in their past.
